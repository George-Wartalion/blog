Greetings to everyone and let's get straight to the point the only real qualification that I have, as of writing this page, is being a 1st year CS student that has been dabbling in game dev for the past 5 years, nothing serious mind you. My other qualifications are that I've tried to learn art for the last 4 years (1 year of 3D modeling and rendering and 3 years of digital drawing and painting) and writing fiction for the last 1.5 years. 
My attempts at learning the skills mentioned above have ultimately failed, sure I can draw a line free hand straighter than with a ruler and understand the elements of a story and predict what comes next in it. But if you asked me to write a book or draw a portrait, while I would know what I should do I couldn't do it even if my life depended on it.
With that out of the way if for whatever reason want to follow what I'm doing here are the links to my social media accounts:
